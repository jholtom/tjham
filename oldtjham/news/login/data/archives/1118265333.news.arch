Will managed to melt a penny sized hole in the lid of the petri dish being used as a project box, and almost burned himself picking up a penny he had just melted solder all over. Robert & Alice helped with the progress of the radio and Nathan collapsed on the table. People told corny jokes & puns.<br /><br />* The tentative date for the Smithsonian trip is now June 23<br /><br />* The solder we used today belongs to Robert|||||

1115597897|nwatson|New Site|I've got the new site more or less up with a little help from Lee. I'll rework some of the Gallery themes so that we might make it look decent, but I'm hoping Gallery2 comes out of beta version land soon so that themes are more readily available. The news script seems to be working well. We might move the site to tjarc.org soon, providing that Jack registers the domain name at some point.|||||

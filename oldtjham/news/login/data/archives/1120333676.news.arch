1119933897|nwatson|NN3SI Trip|THe NN3SI trip went well; those of you who were there don't really need much of a summary...if someone else feels like updating this with more detail please do so; I might when I'm a little bit more awake.|||||
1118898795|nwatson|Last Meeting|June 15 was our last meeting for the 2004-2005 school year, as well as Robert Moffatt appreciation day. Food was consumed. Conversation was had. Pictures were taken (and are now up in the gallery). Robert was appreciated. Officers were elected and are as before:<br /><br />Lee - President<br />Nathan - Vice President<br />Will - Secretary / Treasurer<br />Jack - Activities Coordinator<br /><br />See the emails that have been going around for more info on the Smithsonian trip & HAMfest, but as far as I know Mr. Bosch is taking us from TJ to DC on the 25, then to the HAMfest, then back to TJ on the 26.<br /><br />I'm currently revising the Constitution and it will be sent out on the mailing list for approval when complete.|||||
1118266947|nwatson|More Stuff|Today we were visited by Ben Gelb. He helped us determine that our antenna does, in fact, rotate. We adjusted it to the direction Mr. Bosch found most appropriate. The date of the trip has also been moved to 6/25, and there is a HAM fest of sorts after that...see the email about it in the mailing list for more details. As for officers for next year, current standings are (these can be changed if anyone objects during the next and last meeting):<br /><br />Lee Burton - President<br />Nathan Watson - Vice President & Webmaster<br />Jack Breese - Activities Coordinator<br />Will McGrath - Secretary/Treasurer<br /><br />And for your amusement - members graduating this year:<br /><br />Robert Moffatt - MIT<br />Alice Ohlson - MIT<br />Jesse Warlick - UVA|||||
